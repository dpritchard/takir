## Resubmission
This is a resubmission.
This is the first release and there is no change in functionality, therefore the version number is unchanged. 
 
Following suggestions from Brain Ripley / CRAN, in this submission I have:

- Quoted "State of the Takiwa" throughout DESCRIPTION.
- Modified the Title, including removing redundant "in R".
- Removed redundant phrases from the Description (e.g. "This package contains").
- Rewritten the Description to describe what the package actually provides, not broader project aims (which I agree are of limited interest to the wider R community).  
- Sorted out my testing environment so I don't get erroneous NOTEs

## Test environments
- Local OS X (Yosemite, v. 10.10.1): R 3.1.2
- Win-Builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.

There was 1 NOTE

* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
  Maintainer: 'Daniel Pritchard <daniel@pritchard.co>'
  New submission

This is expected, as this is a new submission for me.  The initial release is very simple, but we will build on this over time.

## Downstream dependancies
There are none, nor am I expecting there to be very many (if any) in the foreseeable future!
