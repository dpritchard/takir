Description: This package contains functions to analyse State of the Takiwa
	data collected as part of the Te Runanga o Ngai Tahu monitoring
	programme, in Aotearoa (New Zealand). It has been provided to support a
	redevelopment of the existing State of the Takiwa toolset, as part of the
	"Takiwa 3.0" project. This project aims to provide tangata whenua (people
	of the land) with information to guide policy development and inform a ki
	uta ki tai (mountains to the sea) environmental management strategy.
	The initial focus of the project is on the Marine Cultural Health Index
	(MCHI), a citizen science survey and semi-quantitative assessment tool
	that focuses on near-shore fish species and the habitats that support
	them.
