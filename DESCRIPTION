Description: takiwaR is designed to support community-led ecological surveys
	(citizen science) as part of a "State of the Takiwa" monitoring
	programme. It provides functions to calculate semi-quantitative
	environmental assessment metrics, collectively known as Cultural Health
	Indices (CHI). These indices emphasise traditional or cultural values
	of the environment (ecosystem services), particularly the ability to
	harvest food. The initial focus of the package is on the Marine Cultural
	Health Index (MCHI), a survey tool that targets near-shore fish
	species and the habitats that support them. takiwaR has been provided to
	support a redevelopment of the existing Takiwa toolset, as part of the
	Takiwa 3.0 project.
