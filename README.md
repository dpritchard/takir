# takiwaR

This package contains functions to analyse State of the Takiwā data collected as part of the Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu monitoring programme, in Aotearoa (New Zealand). 

The initial focus of the project is on the Marine Cultural Health Index (MCHI), a citizen science survey and semi-quantitative assessment tool that focuses on near-shore fish species and the habitats that support them.

Currently the package is under heavy development, but you can install:

-   the latest released version from CRAN with

    ``` r
    install.packages("takiwaR")
    ```

-   or the latest development version from github with

    ``` r
    if (packageVersion("devtools") < 1.6) {
      install.packages("devtools")
    }
    devtools::install_github("dpritchard/takiwaR")
    ```
